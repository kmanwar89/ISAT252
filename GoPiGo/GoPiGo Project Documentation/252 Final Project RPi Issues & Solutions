issue: IP keeps changing
cause: unknown, but suspect that a separate config in /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf and /etc/network/interfaces causing conflicts
solution: ONLY use /etc/network/interfaces.  comment out everything in the other file.

ok so I'm typing this guide up as my brain works.  I completed a fresh install of the dexter industries customized version of raspbian for the GoPiGo.  After installing I had some issues with the wifi because nothing was configured.  So here's what I did:

I tried a bunch of different settings in the /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf file, but those didn't work.  I also tried some stuff generating a wpa_psk passphrase using 'wpa_passphrase "SSID" "PSK"', but that wasn't necessary.  So here's what I discovered.  First things first, ignore the /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf file -- it's not needed.  Do the following:

1)  sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf and comment out (add a # to) every line in there.  This will preseve the file in case you need it later, but will basically make it not matter for the time being.

2)  In the initial /etc/network/interfaces file, there will be the following lines:

auto lo

iface lo inet loopback
iface eth0 inet dhcp

allow-hotplug wlan0
iface wlan0 inet manual
wpa-roam /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
iface wlan0 inet dhcp


You'll want to comment out lines 6-9, inclusive, meaning everything having to do with wlan0.  This causes an issue because basically what this is saying is use the /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf to gather the configuration settings --- we don't want that.  We will do a much simpler configuration.

still inside the /etc/network/interfaces file, press enter a few times and use # and enter a comment about the changes you are making.  In this case, we're adding a static IP configuration to the raspberry pi.  I usually put the date, and who made the change. So in my case, I'd do the following:

# Adding static IP configuration for GoPiGo 252 Project -- KMA 4/27/2015
setting1
setting2
setting3
setting4

etc.  So now we're going to gather some information we need before we finish configuring.  If you don't understand what these mean, ask the professor or TA for a better explanation.

Type the following commands verbatim:

iwconfig

ifconfig
