Lab 7 - Water Quality - Pseudo Code

main() pseudo code:

Present user a menu
ask user which file they want to open, labpH.txt (1) or Turbidity.txt (2)
if the choice is not 1 and 2: (while loop)
	ask the user for input and assign that to a variable
		if the choice is not 1 and not 2
			print an error telling the user to pick from only 1 or 2
		otherwise
			exit the loop

if the choice is 1, assign 'labpH.txt' to a variable name (filename)
if the choice is 2, assign 'turbidity.txt' to a variable name (filename)

pass filename to the calculate_average function to calculate average values




calculate_average pseudo code:

open the file given by variable 'filename'
	store the first line of the file as a header (string)
	    if the first line is not empty (for loop)
		read every line in the file until it reaches the end
		add each value to the 'total' variable to keep track
		increment the counter by 1
	calculate average of values (total values / counter)
	display file header and average values in a human-readable string
close the file

call the main function
